# Lua Turtle Programs for ComputerCraft

## Introduction

This repository hosts a collection of custom scripts written in Lua for ComputerCraft turtles. These scripts have been crafted with the goal of enhancing the productivity and automation of your Minecraft experience. Note that these scripts are written without considering fuel limitations, so ensure your turtles are adequately powered.

## Scripts

Here's a brief description of the scripts included in this repository:

1. `movement.lua`: This is a library script that aids in tracking movement and includes various convenience functions. This code is utilized by all other scripts in this repository.
    
2. `quarry.lua`: This is a dynamic quarry program that allows the user to define the quarry size. It comes with an optional trash filtering mechanism, helping you keep only the valuables.
    
3. `sugarCane.lua`: A specialized script that navigates through a sugarcane farm and crafts paper directly. The navigation process is guided by block indicators: deepslate block indicates a right turn, cobblestone signals a left turn, and a dirt block signifies the end of the farm.
    
4. `treeFarm.lua`: An efficient spruce tree farming script. This script can utilize bonemeal, if available, to speed up the tree growth.
